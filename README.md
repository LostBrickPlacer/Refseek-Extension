# Refseek

RefSeek is a web search engine for students and researchers that aims to make academic information easily accessible to everyone. RefSeek searches more than five billion documents, including web pages, books, encyclopedias, journals, and newspapers.

RefSeek's unique approach offers students comprehensive subject coverage without the information overload of a general search engineâ€”increasing the visibility of academic information and compelling ideas that are often lost in a muddle of sponsored links and commercial results.
